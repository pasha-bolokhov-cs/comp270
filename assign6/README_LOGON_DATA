SetUID part
-----------

C wrapper (wrapsuid.c) program is attached, but everything is stored in
	/home/bolokhov/comp270/assign6/

The binary is installed as /usr/sbin/wrapsuid

The script is called "script-cat.pl"

Remark: in order to package all files and attach them, I temporarily restored the
read attribute of "test.txt" for everyone, also left "root" as the owner
After packaging, I again changed it to rw-------


Kill part
---------

A perl script "useless-bolokhov.pl" is attached. The name is so the file is unique.
A couple of images of the program and of "top" running concurrently are attached
(using "tmux" which is a better version of "screen"; both "tmux" and "ssh" use quite
a bit of resource when the program is running)

In the "top" window, I did "sigstop", "sigcont" and "sigkill" the process. Near
same effects are done by hitting Ctrl-Z and then "bg" or "fg", or just "kill".
