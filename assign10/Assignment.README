"partition.output"	-	I tried to learn to used "parted" to create a partition.
				Although I didn't use it for this assignment, the useful thing is that
				you can give it commands right on the command line and not going into the CLI

				Output of all relevant commands (e.g. 'mkfs') is given in this file


"swap.output"		-	This one is pretty straightforward
