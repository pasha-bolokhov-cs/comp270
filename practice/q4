Run the following command:
    $ cat illegal.txt | sed 's/^.* from \([0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\)$/\1/' | sort | uniq
    121.17.174.5
    201.134.103.165
    60.216.12.25
    60.217.224.242
    92.48.122.209

    (if we just used 's/^.* from //' there might have been a user named "from" which would have
     cut the omitted portion prematurely)
