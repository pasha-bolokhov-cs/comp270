Description of attached files:

named.conf     -  	config
comp270.hosts  -	domain
upgrade.hosts  -	another domain

IP address: 204.174.60.77


1.  Now, an important problem:

    $ dig @204.174.60.77 selia.comp270.comp

returns a "REFUSED" error (this is also logged in '/var/log/messages' on the server) if executed remotely.
An example record from 'messages' of a similar request:

Nov 25 23:53:38 comp270-46 named[20783]: client 204.174.60.16#58573 (comp270.comp): query 'comp270.comp/A/IN' denied

I found discussion about this by Victoria, but her message was unanswered. Looks like she switched to 'nslookup', which I don't normally use

I executed those digs and host from deepblue as well as from other places

===========> I already was going to submit the assignment with this thing left as it is, when I discovered that the "allow-query" option in "named.conf" was the cause (not the recursion restriction). 


2.  There are a few sample 'dig' output files:

    for example "dig-@204.174.60.77-station.upgrade.comp", as well as the CNN example

    I suggest doing these command to test the server:

$ dig @204.174.60.77 deepblue.comp270.comp
$ dig @204.174.60.77 selia.comp270.comp
$ dig @204.174.60.77 station.upgrade.comp
$ dig @204.174.60.77 printers.upgrade.comp
